            <p>We are moving over to Bootstrap 5 from sprint 39 and onwards.</p>
            <p>
              The goal of this challenge is to get the opportunity to explore
              Bootstrap 5 in an environment outside of our code base. Please
              take this time to figure out what tools and utility classes
              Bootstrap 5 provides us.
            </p>
            <p>
              The instructions for the challenge can be found at
              <code>/blogr-landing-page-main/README.md</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Once completed, you will be responsible for reviewing one other
              developer's submission and provide feedback to them.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Make sure to fork this StackBlitz before starting.</strong
              ><br />
              Once done, share your StackBlitz with your assigned reviewer.
              Submission cut-off will be Monday (20 November) @ 8:00AM. You are
              welcome to to this during working hours today and tomorrow, but
              please make sure you prioritise Sprint 38 tickets. Bug duty also
              needs to take priority.
            </p>
            <p>Good luck!</p>
